Currently examples, would be filled by running 'code/phenotypic_traits/run_get_growth_layer_depth.m'

.mat files consist of:
dy: displacement along the average direction of motion between pairs of beads in the same timepoint (see manuscript supplementary information) 
ratio: ratio of velocities of two beads projected along the average direction of motion
dy_binned: dy values binned
ratio_binned: mean ratios in each bin
ratio_err_binned: standard error of the mean ratio within each bin
d: growth layer depth in microns
derr: growth layer depth error in microns
